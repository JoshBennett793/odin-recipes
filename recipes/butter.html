                <li>Add the apples, spices, chopped lemon, and water
                    to a preserving pan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat,

                    reduced to a pulp.</li>

                <li>Press the micture through a fine sieve, then weigh the resulting
                    purée and put it into a clean pan. For every 1 pound of purée add scant
                    2 cups of sugar and cook over low heat, stirring continuously, until the
                    sugar has completely dissolved. Increase the heat to medium, then cook 
                    for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently, until the mixture is reduced
