        <img src="img/honeycakes.jpeg" alt="Honey Cakes">
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe comes from the cookbook "Recipes from the World of Tolkien"
                written by Robert Tuesley Anderson. The cookbook is a compilation of 
                recipes inspired by the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies and literature.</p>
            <p>We will be making honey cakes, as served to the group by Beorn, the 
                shapeshifter. It's no surprise his famous cake recipe calls for 
                honey, as he is an ursine based shapeshifter. Join along as we transport
                our tastebuds into Middle-earth.</p>
