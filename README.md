First TOP Project
Not even entirely sure what a README.md is. Perhaps it's a page for people to read to get a better sense of what the project is supposed to be? Context clues lead me to believe that because that's what I've been asked to do. I'm going to be showcasing what I've learned so far in the HTML foundations part of the TOP curriculum. I've learned the typical HTML boilerplate. How to create both absolute and relative hyperlinks. How to link to images. Of course, I'll be showcasing how to structure the website's headings, paragraphs, and lists. Like the curriculum mentioned, I'm sure it won't look pretty but it'll be pretty cool to see a finished product showing that I have made progress in my learning and provide more motivation toward becoming the developer I imagine I could be. Let's get it!
